# YouGo
MSA Lab Project.

We will make a Mobile Application when you can track your weight progress.

Inside the app you will be able to insert the food that eat so the app can calculate the number of calories that you still need for the day.

You will also add daily track of your weight and if you don't introduce anything in any day, the app will consider that you have the same weight.
